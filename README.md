# Udacity React Development Nanodegree

Here are a part of the exercises and practice done throughout the duration of this React Nanodegree scholarship, offered by egFWD initiative.

In this Nanodegree, I re-visited the core concepts of React, and practiced it much via exercises and projects.

## Status: Complete

I have successfully finished this Nanodegree scholarship, via making and submitting the Nanodegree's final project [[link]](https://github.com/Deadreyo/MyReads-Book-Library).

You can view the certificate [here](https://confirm.udacity.com/DMCR9JYD).

## Content

In this project, I refreshed on concepts like:
- Composition.
- JSX & JavaScript methods.
- Passing props.
- Using and modifying the state (useState).
- Interacting with the life-cycle methods (useEffect).
- Interacting with the browser's URL and make routing (React Router).
- Structuring and organizing components, and identifying correct places to use states and props.

Then went on to make a Book Library project that helps users view, organize and manage books they want to read.
